- BLS shows pairing applications
- Blind signatures for anonymous credentials

## Pairing Deep Dive (Critical Section)

**Why are pairings so important?**

In zkSNARKs, we need to check polynomial equations. Pairings let us verify these equations efficiently:

Without pairings:
- Verifier would need to evaluate polynomials
- Verification would be as expensive as computation

With pairings:
- Prover does polynomial work
- Verifier just checks ONE pairing equation
- e(proof₁, setup₁) = e(proof₂, setup₂)

**The magic**: Pairing bilinearity lets you "check equations in the exponent"

Example:
- Want to check: a·b = c
- Without pairings: Need to know a, b, c
- With pairings: Check e(g^a, h^b) = e(g, h)^c
- Verifier never learns a, b, c!

**This is why zkSNARKs are succinct.**

## Curves Used in Practice

### BN254 (alt_bn128):
- Used in Ethereum, Zcash (old)
- 254-bit security
- Type-3 pairing
- Very efficient

### BLS12-381:
- Used in Zcash (new), Ethereum 2.0, Filecoin
- 381-bit security
- Better security level than BN254
- Type-3 pairing

### BN curves vs. BLS curves:
- BLS curves: Better security at larger sizes
- BN curves: More efficient at smaller sizes

**For learning**: Start with BN254 (more examples available)

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to understand the math behind pairings deeply?**
A: You need to understand WHAT pairings do and WHY they're useful. The internal math (Weil/Tate) is advanced—focus on properties and applications.

**Q: Can I skip elliptic curves and just use pairings?**
A: No. Pairings are built on elliptic curves. You need EC foundations first.

**Q: Why Pedersen commitments instead of hash commitments?**
A: Pedersen commitments are homomorphic: C(m₁) · C(m₂) = C(m₁ + m₂). This is crucial for many ZK protocols.

**Q: Do I need to implement pairings from scratch?**
A: No. Use libraries. But understand what they do.

**Q: What's the difference between Type-1, Type-2, Type-3 pairings?**
A: Where the groups come from. Type-3 (G₁ ≠ G₂) is most efficient and commonly used.
