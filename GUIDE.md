## Security Enclaves Note

**No dedicated folder for security enclaves** (SGX, TrustZone, etc.)

Security enclaves are **hardware-based trusted execution environments**, which is a different paradigm from cryptographic protocols. For enclaves:
- Focus on understanding trusted computing
- Read about Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone separately
- Understand how ZK can complement or replace enclave trust assumptions
- Some root papers may discuss attestation and trusted hardware

**Recommendation**: Learn ZK/crypto foundations first, then study enclaves from separate resources.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Complete Beginner**: Follow "Quick Start" section, then "Recommended Reading Order"
2. **Some Crypto Background**: Skip to Phase 3 (Zero-Knowledge Foundations)
3. **Focused on FHE**: Read foundations (Phase 1-2), then jump to lattice + FHE
4. **Focused on MPC**: Read foundations, then secret sharing + oblivious transfer
5. **Implementing ZK Systems**: Focus on zero knowledge/ + elliptic curves + pairings

Remember: **Quality over quantity**. Better to deeply understand 20 essential papers than to skim 200.
