## Complete Suggested Naming Scheme

### Option A: Clear and Professional ⭐⭐⭐

```
01_mathematical_foundations/
02_cryptographic_primitives/
03_zero_knowledge_proofs/
04_multiparty_computation/
05_lattices_and_fully_homomorphic_encryption/
06_applications_credentials_and_privacy/
07_advanced_topics_and_post_quantum/
08_supplementary_specialized_topics/
```

**Pros:**
- Clear and unambiguous
- Professional naming
- Logical progression
- No acronyms (accessible to beginners)

**Cons:**
- Longer names
- More typing

---

### Option B: Concise and Modern

```
01_math_foundations/
02_elliptic_curves_and_pairings/
03_zero_knowledge_proofs/
04_secure_multiparty_computation/
05_lattice_crypto_and_fhe/
06_privacy_applications/
07_proof_systems_and_pqc/
08_optional_topics/
```

**Pros:**
- Shorter than Option A
- Still descriptive
- Good balance

**Cons:**
- Some acronyms remain (FHE, PQC)

---

### Option C: Maximally Descriptive

```
01_algebra_number_theory_and_finite_fields/
02_elliptic_curves_pairings_hashes_and_signatures/
03_zero_knowledge_proofs_and_snarks/
04_multiparty_computation_secret_sharing_and_ot/
05_lattices_lwe_and_fully_homomorphic_encryption/
06_anonymous_credentials_and_private_payments/
07_advanced_proof_systems_and_post_quantum/
08_side_channels_and_specialized_topics_skip/
```

**Pros:**

---

## My Top Recommendation: Option A with Tweaks ⭐⭐⭐

```
01_mathematical_foundations/
02_elliptic_curves_pairings_and_primitives/
03_zero_knowledge_proofs/
04_multiparty_computation/
05_lattices_and_fully_homomorphic_encryption/
06_applications_anonymous_credentials_and_privacy/
07_advanced_topics_and_post_quantum/
08_optional_specialized_topics/
```

### Rationale:
1. **01**: Keep "mathematical_foundations" (clear and standard)
2. **02**: Emphasize EC and pairings (crucial for ZK) but include other primitives
3. **03**: Spell out "zero_knowledge_proofs" (no ambiguity)
4. **04**: Spell out "multiparty_computation" (beginners won't know MPC)
5. **05**: Lattices first, FHE second (logical order)
6. **06**: Specify applications content (not just "applications")
7. **07**: "Advanced topics" signals optional + complex
8. **08**: "Optional" in name = clear signal to skip

---

## Alternative Minimal Change Approach

If you want to minimize disruption, just fix the most problematic names:

### Changes:
- **04**: `mpc` → `multiparty_computation` (spell out acronym)
- **05**: `fhe_and_lattices` → `lattices_and_fhe` (better order)
- **06**: `applications` → `applications_credentials_and_privacy` (add specificity)
- **07**: `systems_proofs_and_post_quantum_foundations` → `advanced_topics_and_post_quantum` (shorter, clearer)
- **08**: `real_world_security_and_privacy_addons` → `optional_specialized_topics` (clear it's optional)

### Keep unchanged:
- **01**: `math_foundations` (good enough)
- **02**: `crypto_primitives` (acceptable)
- **03**: `zero_knowledge` (iconic and clear)

---

## Consider Your Audience

### For Academic/Research Audience:
Use Option A (professional, clear, complete names)

### For Self-Learners/Beginners:
Use Option A with extra descriptiveness in 06-08

### For Experienced Crypto People:
Current names are mostly fine, just fix 07 and 08

## Summary of Key Issues with Current Names

1. ✅ **Chapters 01-03**: Generally good
2. ⚠️ **Chapter 04**: "MPC" is an acronym - spell it out
3. ⚠️ **Chapter 05**: Order is backward (lattices enable FHE, not vice versa)
4. ⚠️ **Chapter 06**: Too generic ("applications" of what?)
5. ❌ **Chapter 07**: Way too long and unclear what's inside
6. ❌ **Chapter 08**: Confusing name, doesn't signal "skip this"

---

## Implementation Suggestion

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues (Do This Now)
- Rename 07 to something shorter and clearer
- Rename 08 to signal it's optional
- Consider 04 (spell out MPC)

### Phase 2: Polish (Optional)
- Reorder 05 (lattices before FHE)
- Add specificity to 06
- Spell out full names in 02-04

### Phase 3: Full Optimization (If Starting Fresh)
- Implement Option A completely
- Update all cross-references
- Update documentation

---

## Final Recommendation

**Immediate action (minimal disruption):**

```
04_mpc → 04_multiparty_computation
05_fhe_and_lattices → 05_lattices_and_fhe
07_systems_proofs_and_post_quantum_foundations → 07_advanced_topics_and_post_quantum
08_real_world_security_and_privacy_addons → 08_optional_topics_skip_for_beginners
```

**Ideal final state (if reorg):**

```
01_mathematical_foundations
02_elliptic_curves_pairings_and_primitives
03_zero_knowledge_proofs
04_multiparty_computation
05_lattices_and_fully_homomorphic_encryption
06_applications_credentials_and_privacy
07_advanced_topics_and_post_quantum
08_supplementary_topics
```

This provides maximum clarity while maintaining a clean, professional structure!
