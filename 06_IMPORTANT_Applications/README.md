## Learning Path

### Week 1-2: Cryptocurrencies & ZK

**Goal**: Understand how ZK enables private cryptocurrencies

**Read** (from cryptocurrencies/ + root):

1. ⭐⭐⭐ **"Zerocash: Decentralized Anonymous Payments from Bitcoin (2014)"**
   - **Must read**: Complete zkSNARK application
   - Basis of Zcash cryptocurrency
   - Shows end-to-end ZK system design

2. ⭐⭐⭐ **"Zerocash [extended] (2014)"** - Full technical details

3. ⭐⭐⭐ **"Zerocoin: Anonymous Distributed E-Cash from Bitcoin (2013)"**
   - Predecessor to Zerocash
   - Different ZK approach
   - Simpler but less efficient

4. ⭐⭐⭐ **"CryptoNote v2.0 [used in Monero and ByteCoin] (2013)"**
   - Different privacy approach
   - Ring signatures instead of SNARKs
   - Used in Monero

5. ⭐⭐ Other privacy coin papers in cryptocurrencies/

**Key Concepts**:

**Zerocash/Zcash**:
- zkSNARKs for transaction privacy
- Hides sender, receiver, amount
- Uses Groth16 zkSNARK
- Trusted setup ceremony
- Full privacy (shielded transactions)

**Zerocoin**:
- Earlier ZK approach
- Accumulator-based
- Less efficient than Zerocash
- Zcoin (now Firo) uses variant

**CryptoNote/Monero**:
- Ring signatures (mixing)
- Stealth addresses
- Confidential transactions
- No trusted setup
- Different tradeoffs than SNARKs

**Self-Check**:
- How does Zerocash use zkSNARKs?
- What's the difference between Zcash and Monero's privacy?
- Why does Zcash need a trusted setup?

**Hands-On**:
1. Read Zcash documentation
2. Understand shielded vs. transparent transactions
3. Compare privacy models: SNARKs vs. ring signatures

**Why This Matters**:
- Largest real-world deployment of zkSNARKs
- Shows practical ZK system design
- Demonstrates trusted setup in practice
- Reveals tradeoffs (privacy vs. performance vs. trust)

### Week 2-3: Anonymous Credentials

**Goal**: Understand privacy-preserving authentication

**Read** (from anonymous credentials/):

1. ⭐⭐⭐ Start with introductory credential papers

2. ⭐⭐⭐ Papers on blind signatures
   - Chaum's blind signatures
   - Foundation of anonymous credentials

3. ⭐⭐⭐ Attribute-based credentials
   - Prove properties without revealing identity
   - "I'm over 18" without showing age
   - "I have degree from university X"

4. ⭐⭐ E-cash papers
   - Anonymous digital cash
   - Untraceable payments
   - Prevents double-spending

5. ⭐⭐ Papers by Camenisch, Lysyanskaya (major contributors)

**Key Concepts**:

**Anonymous Credentials**:
- Prove attributes without revealing identity
- Uses ZK proofs of knowledge
- Selective disclosure (show only what's needed)
- Unlinkability (can't track user across uses)

**Blind Signatures**:
- User gets signature without revealing message
- Foundation of e-cash
- Privacy-preserving authentication

**E-Cash**:
- Digital cash that's untraceable (like physical cash)
- Prevents double-spending cryptographically
- Blind signatures + ZK proofs

**Applications**:
- Privacy-preserving identity systems
- Anonymous voting
- Unlinkable authentication tokens
- Digital cash

**Self-Check**:
- How do blind signatures enable anonymous e-cash?
- What's selective disclosure in credentials?
- How do you prevent double-spending in anonymous e-cash?

**Hands-On**:
1. Understand a simple blind signature scheme
2. Trace through anonymous credential issuance/showing
3. See how ZK proves attributes

**Why This Matters**:
- Practical privacy technology
- Shows ZK beyond cryptocurrencies
- Real identity systems need this
- Combines multiple ZK techniques

### Week 3-4: Authenticated Encryption & Other Applications

**Goal**: Broader cryptographic applications

**Read** (from authenticated encryption/):

1. ⭐⭐ Introduction to authenticated encryption (AEAD)
2. ⭐⭐ AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305 papers
3. ⭐⭐ Sponge construction (Keccak/SHA-3)

**Key Concepts**:

**Authenticated Encryption**:
- Encryption + authentication in one
- Prevents tampering with ciphertexts
- GCM, CCM, OCB, ChaCha20-Poly1305
- Standard in TLS, SSH, etc.

**Note**: This is more traditional crypto, less ZK-focused. Included because:
- Understanding practical crypto is important
- Some AEAD schemes use interesting constructions
- Shows crypto beyond ZK

**Read selectively** - not all papers needed unless interested in symmetric crypto.

## Key Lessons from Applications

### Design Tradeoffs:

**Zcash (SNARKs)**:
- ✅ Strong privacy (hides everything)
- ✅ Small proofs, fast verification
- ❌ Trusted setup required
- ❌ Slow proof generation

**Monero (Ring Signatures)**:
- ✅ No trusted setup
- ✅ Easier to understand
- ❌ Weaker privacy (mixing vs. hiding)
- ❌ Larger transactions

**Lessons**:
- No perfect solution - always tradeoffs
- Different approaches for different goals
- Trust assumptions matter
- Performance vs. security vs. simplicity

### Practical Challenges:

1. **Trusted Setup**:
   - Zcash ceremony with 90+ participants
   - Single point of failure if compromised
   - Modern solutions: universal setups, transparent SNARKs

2. **Performance**:
   - Proof generation is slow
   - Limits throughput
   - Optimizations: specialized circuits, better schemes

3. **Usability**:
   - Privacy requires opt-in (shielded transactions)
   - Most Zcash usage is transparent (not private!)
   - Lesson: Default matters

4. **Regulatory**:
   - Privacy coins face regulatory pressure
   - Need balance between privacy and compliance
   - ZK can enable selective disclosure

## FAQ

**Q: Should I read this folder before or after learning ZK theory?**
A: After. Theory first (folder 03), then applications.

**Q: Which is better: Zcash or Monero?**
A: Different tradeoffs. Zcash: stronger privacy but trusted setup. Monero: no setup but weaker privacy. Both useful.

**Q: Is trusted setup a dealbreaker?**
A: Depends. Ceremonies can make it acceptable. Or use transparent systems (STARKs, Bulletproofs).

**Q: Are privacy coins illegal?**
A: Legality varies by jurisdiction. They face regulatory scrutiny but aren't universally illegal.

**Q: What's the biggest ZK application?**
A: Probably Ethereum ZK-rollups (zkSync, StarkNet) by transaction volume. Zcash by cryptocurrency market cap.

**Q: Should I focus on SNARKs or STARKs?**
A: Learn SNARKs first (this library), then STARKs. Both are important.

## Why Applications Matter

**Theory tells you what's possible. Applications show you what's practical.**

By studying real systems, you learn:
- What works in practice
- Common pitfalls
- Tradeoffs you must make
- How to design secure systems

**This completes your ZK education from theory to practice.**

---

**Remember**: Applications reveal the gap between theory and practice. Understanding both makes you a complete cryptographer.
