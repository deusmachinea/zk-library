# 01 - ESSENTIAL Mathematical Foundations

## Priority: ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL - START HERE

## Why This Matters

**You cannot understand cryptography without this foundation.**

All of cryptography—including zero-knowledge proofs, FHE, and MPC—is built on:
- **Number theory**: Primes, modular arithmetic, discrete logarithm problem
- **Algebra**: Groups, rings, fields, finite fields
- **Mathematical structures**: The frameworks that make crypto secure

**Skip this at your peril.** Trying to learn ZK without number theory is like trying to build a house without understanding materials.

## Time Estimate

**2-4 weeks** of focused study (10-20 hours/week)

## FAQ

**Q: How much math do I really need?**
A: All of it in this folder. Every paper in ZK assumes you know this cold.

**Q: Can I skip to ZK and come back when needed?**
A: No. You'll be constantly confused. Invest the time now.

**Q: I'm not good at math. Can I still learn ZK?**
A: Yes! But you need to work through this methodically. Take 6-8 weeks if needed.

**Q: Do I need abstract algebra courses?**
A: Not full courses, but you need groups/rings/fields from this folder.

**Q: What about linear algebra?**
A: Some papers assume it. Khan Academy has good linear algebra courses.

## Self-Assessment

After finishing this folder, you should be able to:

✅ Explain the discrete logarithm problem
✅ Perform modular arithmetic confidently
✅ Understand what a cyclic group is
✅ Work with finite fields GF(p)
✅ Explain why certain mathematical problems are hard
✅ Understand security reductions
✅ Read cryptographic papers that assume math background

If you can't do these, spend more time here before moving on.

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered this material:

**→ Go to [02_ESSENTIAL_Crypto_Primitives/README.md](../02_ESSENTIAL_Crypto_Primitives/README.md)**

You'll learn:
- Elliptic curve cryptography
